# boatnet
A collection of software intended to be used on my boat

This will probably be a bunch of Arduino nodes, perhaps Adafruit feathers, that each handles a certain task.
The first one will be manouvering the electric valve that I intend to put instead of the check valve that came with the boat.

If possible, the nodes will communicate using BLE.
